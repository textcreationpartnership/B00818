         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For they leaue vs, when we leaue the world, and they nothing availe vs in the day of triall, when our bodies ſhall deſcend into the ſlimie vally, &amp; our ſoules returne to God that gaue them, then all the

And then what ſhall bee his ſtay, where ſhall be his ſhelter, what will remaine to bee done, but with that ſad and diſconſolate Heathen, to ſhut vp all in that hopeleſſe and helpleſſe lamentation, <hi>Anxius vixi, dubius morior, heu quo vado,</hi> I haue ſquandred out my life in an vnfruitfull way, I haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved vnreſoluedly, and die doubtfully, and now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther away O my ſoule, woe is thee and alas for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Containing a deſcription of Eternitie, with a briefe declaration of the nature and condition of it.</head>
                  <p>ETernitie is an infinite, endleſſe, bottomeleſſe gulfe, which no line can faddome, no time can reach, no age can extend to, no tongue can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe. It is a duration alwaies preſent, a being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in being, it is one perpetuall day, which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee an Euening. Infinite are the deſcriptions of the Ancients, and divers their expreſſions, touching this Eternitie. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> conceiuing that God was eternall, and his duration and being to bee properly tearmed Eternitie, repreſented the diuine power by a Circle, which had neither beginning nor end. And hence it was that the Ancient Romans erected Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which they dedicated to their Gods in a circular figure. Thus <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> deuoted a round Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Maieſtie of <hi>Veſta.</hi> And <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> the like in honour of all the Gods: <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the better to expreſſe that God was eternall, commanded his Schollers that ſo oft as they accommodated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the worſhip of God, they ſhould turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues round. The Turkes euery morning aſcend into an high Tower built in the faſhion of the <hi>Egyptian Pyramides,</hi> where they deuoutly ſalute their God and Mahomet, crying with a lowd and roaring voice, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us ſemper fuit, ſemper<expan>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:181127:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> true Eternitie by an intellectuall ſpheare, whoſe Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was euery where, but without any circumference, becauſe he was the beginning and ende of all things, not bounded within any compaſſe, nor terminated in any limits. It was an vſuall cuſtome among the <hi>Naſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> an ancient people in <hi>Africa,</hi> that they coveted to dye ſitting, and would alwaie be buried in the ſame poſture ſitting in Cells vnderneath the earth, and this they did to fignifie by that vnmoueable geſture, that they ſhould now ſing a <hi>requiem</hi> from the buſineſſe of this troubleſome world, and had now ariued at the hauen of eternall quietneſſe: Thus we ſee how theſe miſerable heathen who had no other light but nature, no other guide but thoſe lame and corrupted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which were left in them after the fall, did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding according to their broken and weake apprehenſions, tire out themſelues in the expreſſion of Eternitie, and how euer they were vnhappily igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in the waies of God in this life, yet they earneſtly laboured to know what ſhould become of themſelues hereafter, and to finde out the ſtate of the life to come: Oh how iuſtly might I (were it not a digreſſion) take vp a lamentation and deplore the wretched condition of our times, how ſhort doe wee fall, euen of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Heathens, what man is there amongſt vs, that caſteth forth ſo much as a thought vpon Eternity? wee liue here as if there were no life hereafter. Our Earth is our Heauen, and our pleaſures, our Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, we crowne our heads with roſe buds, wee eate of the fat, and drinke of the ſweet, and ſay in our hearts, no euill ſhall happen to vs, &amp; yet when we haue done

For as one hath it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently<note n="*" place="margin">Diſpone &amp; ordina omnia ſecundum tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um velle &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, &amp; non invenies, niſi ſemper a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid pati de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere, autſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te aut invite &amp; ita crucem ſemper inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> diſpoſe &amp; marſhall all things to thine own hearts deſire, yet ſhalt thou (doe what thou canſt) ſtill meet with ſome croſſe or preſure in the way.

Certainely there is no true reſt but that which is eternall, &amp; the ſweeteſt refreſhment our ſoules can finde in this world, conſiſts in the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation of the ioyes to come, in devoting our ſelues and all we haue to his ſeruice, from whom wee haue them, in truſting to him, and relying on him, for out of God the ſoule findes no reſting place to ſet her foot on, but every where ſtormes and waues, death &amp; hell abide her, when we haue improued our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the very height of our deſires, when we haue attained as much happineſſe as the world can giue vs, yet then may we be cut off perchance in the midſt of our daies, when our breaſts are full of milke, and our bones full of marrow, or ſuppoſe we ſpinne the thred of our life to a longer day, and God crowne vs here with the bleſſings of his left hand, the comforts of this life, and length of yeares, yea though all things fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour our longer continuance in this world, yet in the

                     </note> The Sunne ſets, and riſeth againe, but we alas when our glaſſe is runne, and the ſhort gleame of our ſommers day is ſpent, ſhall neuer returne till our laſt ſummons, when the dead ſhall heare the voice of the ſonne of God, and they that heare it ſhall liue, and come forth of their graues, they that haue done good to the reſurrection of life, and they that haue done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to the reſurrection of condemnation, both to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and then ſhall follow that large day, that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhut in, that infinite continuation of time that ſhall neuer end, that vnlimited Eternitie, which ever hath beene, and is, and will be the ſame for euer, when the Sunne ſhall no more yeeld her light by day, nor the Moone her brightneſſe by night, but God ſhall be our light, and the Lord our glory. But oh the vnhappy condition of our age, who is there that ponders theſe things with a digeſted meditation, that lookes into the ſtate of his ſoule with a ſerious eye, that examines his conſcience, vnvaileth his heart, and conſidereth his waies.

                     <hi>CAP. IV.</hi> Explaining how Nature hath repreſented and ſhaddowed out Eternity to vs in ſome of the creatures.</head>
                  <p>NOw to the end wee ſhould bee the farther en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged vnto the inquiſition of eternity, God hath not only planted the knowledge hereof in the hearts of the <hi>Heathens</hi> but hath alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented it in the nature of the creatures. For if wee ſearch with a narrow eye into the ſecrets of nature, how many things ſhall wee finde in the world; as liuely reſemblances, ſhadowing as it were, and trace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out vnto vs this eternity? <hi>Solinus</hi> reports of a ſtone in <hi>Arcadia</hi> which being once inflamed burnes perpetually. And of this matter were your burning lampes made, which continued (as <hi>Hiſtories</hi> ſpeake) ſo many hundreth yeares in ancient Sepulchers. Like herevnto in the nature of it is your <hi>Linum vivum,</hi> a certaine kinde of linnen knowne in <hi>India</hi> which is vncombuſtible, nay it is not only, not conſumed by the fire but it is as it were cleanſed and waſhed &amp; pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by the heate thereof; and hence it was that the body of the ancient <hi>Romane Emperors</hi> when they were to be buried according to the funerall rites of thoſe times, were ſhrouded vp into ſuch linnen to preſerue their aſhes and to avoide a confuſion and mixture of their bodies with common duſt.</p>
                  <p>Behold, here nature it ſelfe ſuggeſts an eternity to thy ſoule, while it preſents to thee ſuch things as the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:181127:9"/> fire cannot conſume, many other ſuch <hi>Symboles</hi> and repreſentations of immortality may bee found in the booke of the creatures. The <hi>Salamander</hi> liueth in the fire and periſheth not, thoſe famous hills in <hi>Sicily</hi> haue beene on fire continually, beyond the memory of man, and yet remaine whole and vnconſumed. The like we reade, of that <hi>O leum incombuſtibile</hi> (as <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> call it) an oyle that ever burnes, but will never waſte, &amp; of the matter of this was that burning torch compoſed, which was found in <hi>Tulliola,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Cicero</hi> her ſepulcher: which continued burning fifteene hundreth yeares. Theſe and many other ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes and traces of eternity, <hi>God</hi> hath vouchſafed vs to ſtirre vp our dead and drowſy hearts to a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act inquiſition and ſerious conſideration of the time to come. For in the booke of the creature wee may ſee the power of the <hi>Creator</hi> and out of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar workes of his we may vnderſtand that, that <hi>God</hi> which hath endowed nature with ſuch admirable qualities can giue the fleſh alſo ſuch a condition, that it ſhall endure according to his mercifull diſpenſation either torments or happineſſe for evermore.</p>
                  <p>Now then to draw all this to an iſſue, ſince it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly true that <hi>God</hi> hath provided an everlaſting being for the ſoules of men in the world to come: ſince he hath engrauen the knowledge hereof as with an Iron pen in the conſciences of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> ſince he hath giuen vs ſo many liuely reſemblances and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof in the ſecrets of nature, and in the workes of his creation, Oh how ſhould the meditation of this take vp our deepeſt thoughts, our refineſt affections?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:181127:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> how ſhould this cauſe vs to reflect vpon our ſoules; to ponder our waies and with an vndazeled and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling eye throughly to trye and to deſcry cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our owne ſtate, whether we be already waſhed with the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and enliuened with a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vigour and life of grace, or yet ly polluted in our owne blood?</p>
                  <p>Oh, how can any man be at reſt and quiet in his minde, till he be aſſured and ſecured in this point; ſince that vpon it depend his everlaſting eſtate in another world? our daies wee ſee are wouen with a ſlender thred, our time ſhort, our end vncertaine, and when the oyle in our lampes is ſpent, and our glaſſe runne out, then <hi>ex vnico momento pendet duplex aeternitas,</hi> we fly in a moment to an everlaſting being either in horror or happineſſe, where wee ſhall receiue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the workes of our hands. If wee haue appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our ſelues ſincere in <hi>Gods</hi> ſervice, iuſt in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diligent in our callings, faithfull in our promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wee ſhall then attaine the end of our faith, the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our ſoules; and the conſcience of our well ſpent life, ſhall at that diſmall day repleniſh our ſoules with abundance of conſolations.</p>
                  <p>Then all our teares ſhall bee wiped from our eyes; what we haue ſowed in ſorrow, we ſhall reape in ioy, when we haue finiſhed our courſe &amp; ended our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with ſinne and death: then ſhall our crowne bee ſure, our victory glorious, and our triumph <hi>Eternall;</hi> our graue ſhall be but as a ſweet refreſhing place to our wearied bodies, and death ſhall be our day ſtarre to everlaſting brightneſſe.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:181127:10"/>
                  <p>But on the other ſide; if wee haue in the whole courſe of our warfare here, expended our pretious time in the ſervice of ſinne and Sathan, and crumbled away the beſt and choiceſt of our yeares in the luſts of the fleſh, and ſports of vanity; then the iſſue of all will be death, and our end deſtruction. Our mirth wil be turned into wormewood, and our ioy into heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: all our delights in this earth ſhall vaniſh as the flower, our ſun ſhall ſet in a cloud, and our daies of iol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and contentation ſhall irrecoverably be involued and turned into perpetuall darkneſſe.</p>

They enioy an <hi>eternity</hi> like the <hi>Saints,</hi> but not the <hi>Saints eternity;</hi> for their eternity ſhall beginne in horror, and proceed in confuſion: their eternity ſhall purchaſe and yeeld to them no other fruit but yellings and lamentations, &amp; woe. Their <hi>eternity</hi> is ſuch as turnes all things into its owne nature: for all things where the damned doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit are eternall. The fire is eternall: for the breath of God like a riuer of brimſtone hath kindled it, and it ſhall neuer goe out night nor day; but the ſmoake thereof ſhall aſcend for euer. The worme is eternall, for the conſcience of the damned ſhall be everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented with the ſenſe of their ſinne: Their worme dieth not, (ſaith the <hi>Prophet</hi>) and their fire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goeth out. The priſon wherein they are incloſed is eternall. The prayers of the <hi>Church</hi> could open the priſon doores to <hi>Peter,</hi> but no prayers can pierce theſe walls, no power can ouerthrowe them, no time can ruine them; out of Hell is no redemption, no ranſome, no deliuery, <hi>Cruciantur damnati, cruciantur in aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> This is the laſt ſentence of the <hi>Iudge,</hi> his irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable decree, his immutable and eternall <hi>Iudgement</hi> vpon the damned, which ſhall neuer bee reuerſed:<note place="margin">Adeſſe intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile, abeſſe impoſſibile.</note> there is no appeale will lye from this <hi>Iudge;</hi> there is
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:181127:11"/> no reverſing this judgement, when the ſentence is once paſt it ſtands for <hi>eternity;</hi> Hence it was that the ancient <hi>Church</hi> repeated this ſentence often in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſervice, <hi>Peccantem me quotidie, &amp; non me peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, timor mortis conturbat me quia in inferno nulla eſt redemptio.</hi> Whilſt I daily ſinne but repent not daily as I ought, the feare of death amazeth me, becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life ended, out of hell is no redemption. The blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhed on <hi>Golgotha,</hi> is fully ſufficient to ſaue all man-kinde, but it belongs not to the damned. If therefore the yoake of repentance ſeeme not ſweet to thee (ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Bernard</hi>) thinke on that yoake which thou ſhalt be ſure to ſuffer, which is Goe yee curſed into eternal fire.

Thus wee ſee the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy eſtate and condition of the damned in the other world, and how the higheſt linke in all this chaine of ſorrowes, wherewith they are enuironed, is the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perpetuitie of their torments, when their reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoughts haue carefully runne through many thouſands of yeares, yet will they not then enioy one day, one little houre, one minute of reſt and reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Everlaſting darkneſſe is their portion, they beginne and end alike, with weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. Now ſince this is certainely true, is it poſſible that man ſhould be ſo forgetfull of <hi>God</hi> and himſelfe? Can he ſo farre degenerate into a beaſt, and indurate into a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:181127:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtone, as to read theſe things and not beleeue them, or beleeue theſe things and not to tremble? Can the knowledge of theſe things ſwim in our braine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſerious and ſound digeſtion of them into our hearts? when we ſee, and knowe, and beleeue, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable, eternall, endleſſe, eaſeleſſe horrors, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true and vnfained repentance, abide vs hereafter; and on the other ſide we knowe not, nor can poſſibly diſcerne with how ſpeedy and ſwift a foot our end approacheth, nor how ſuddenly wee ſhall be ſummo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue the world our euerlaſting farwell; How can ſo ſad and important a conſideration as this, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe our thoughts and not torment them? or how can this chuſe but imbitter our deareſt pleaſures, &amp; croſſe our indulgence to our ſenſuall affections? Did we but reaſon a while with our ſoules, and euery one of vs in a particular application ſay within himſelfe: I am here floating like a ſhip in the ſea of this world ballaſed on every ſide with the cares and diſquietings &amp; preſſures of this life, and I ſayle on with full courſe towards the hauen of Eternity, one little blaſt of death is able to plunge me irrecouerably into this bottomeleſſe gulfe, where one houres torment will infinitely exceed (for the paine of it) an hundred yeares bitter repentance. And ſhall I now thus ſtanding vpon the very battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, melt in my delights, cheere vp my ſelfe in the dayes of my youth, ſhall I tyre out my ſpirits, trifle out my pretious time, rob mine eyes of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued ſleepe for ſuch things, to the which the time will come, when I muſt bid an euerlaſting farewell?

It is our ſinne which hath vnioynted the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and ſocieties of the dumbe creatures, and hath armed them with an antipathy and rebellion one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another.

It is ſin which hath wrought ſuch a confuſion and Chaos in all things vnder the Sunne, which hath changed truth into flattery, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into formes, nature into arte, decency into new fangledneſſe, renting of hearts into cutting of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

And is he yet rich only in mercy? True it is; the earth is the Lords and the fulneſſe thereof, all that wee haue, all that wee are, is his; but his mercy hath an excellency in it aboue all his creatures; yea (if I may ſo ſpeake) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all his attributes, aboue his Iuſtice; Mercy (ſaith

                  <p>So ſoone as ever a man enters this mortall life, hee beginnes a conſtant iourney vnto death, <hi>quicquid temporis vivitur de ſpatio vivendi tollitur: i. e.</hi> Each part of time that wee paſſe, cuts off ſo much from our life, and the remainder ſtill decreaſeth; So that our whole life is nothing but a courſe or paſſage vnto
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:181127:23"/> death, wherein one can neither ſtay nor ſlacke his pace. This wee know, our daily experience doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this truth: and yet doe wee perſiſt as ſecurely as ever in our trade of ſinne: <hi>Aegrae abstrahimur ab ijs quibus aſſueſcimus, i.e.</hi> wee are hardly drawne from thoſe things which cuſtome and time hath invred vs vnto.

Nay looke what a drop of water is to the ſea; the ſame and no more is a thouſand yeares to eternity. Who then of ſound judgement, for the ſhort fruition of a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory contentment in this life, would expoſe himſelfe to the horror of eternall flames in the life to come? And therefore whiles wee haue our abode in this vale of miſery, we ſhould alwaies pray with Saint <hi>Bernard, da domine, vt ſic poſsideamus temporalia, vt non perda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:181127:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> aeterna, i.e.</hi> grant vs <hi>Lord</hi> that wee may ſo partake of temporall felicities, that wee may not looſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. All things vnder the Sunne haue their alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and changings, but things aboue are permanent, and of an enduring ſubſtance. <hi>Omnia ei ſalua ſunt, cui ſalva eſt beata aeternitas;</hi> hee that can be ſecure, and ſure of the happineſſe to come, builds vp his houſe vpon a firme foundation. How ſmall a modell of time, how ſhort a period is the longeſt life, when once it is finiſhed? Recollect with thy ſelfe, ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the yeares that are paſſed from <hi>Adams</hi> time vntill now; run over the whole ſcripture, and the time ſince the fall will ſeeme but as yeſterday. For what are the times paſt? If thou hadſt liued from <hi>Adams</hi> day till this houre; thou wouldſt eaſily haue judged, that this life hath no perpetuity in it, which flies away ſo ſwiftly. For what is the life of any man, ſuppoſe the longeſt age? It is but like the morning dew, like the twinkling of an eye, in a trice it is gone. I haue ſeene an end of all perfection ſaith <hi>David.</hi> But here ô Chriſtian, let me deale more plainely with thee; thou wilt readily acknowledge all things vnder the frame of Heaven are periſhing, and heauen is thy thought, Eternity is thine ayme. Now if it bee ſo, why art thou then ſo dul in thy courſe of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo frozen in thy zeale, ſo inclinable to every motion of ſinne, ſo eaſily ouercome by euery incitement to wantonneſſe, never more calme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably patient, then when thy affections ſhould be enflamed, and thy heart kindled with a iuſt indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Gods cauſe: and on the other ſide neuer more
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:181127:25"/> fretting, whining and vnquiet, then when thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be meeke and patient, and cheerefully diſpoſed vnder the burden of of afflictions? How can it be that we ſhould haue eternity in our mindes, and yet liue no better in our manners? Now that we may the eaſier diſcerne the deceitfulneſſe of our hearts herein; let vs examine our ſelues by the example of <hi>Iacob.</hi> This <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Iacob</hi> ſerued his vncle <hi>Laban</hi> ſeauen yeares for <hi>Rachell</hi> his daughter, and the greatneſſe of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards her, made that time ſeeme but as a few dayes. (to apply this:) Thou art a ſeruant as <hi>Iacob</hi> was, but thou ſerues not ſuch a Maſter as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, thou ſerues not man but God, thy maker and a faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder; thou ſerues not for a wife, but for a kingdome; not for an earthly contentation, but for an heauenly habitation: And yet behold the ſhort affliction of one day can eneruate thy loue, and vnlocke thy affections from God and heauen: Euery croſſe accident ſtops thee in thy courſe, Euery little ſorrow diſquiets thy ſoule, and leſſens thy contentment. Behold here, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure by the example of <hi>Iacob</hi> the ſtrength of thy loue: <hi>Iacob</hi> could ſerue ſeauen yeares with chearefulneſſe for a wife, but thou canſt hardly ſerue thy <hi>God</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes with a true affection for heauen: For reckon vp all the nights thou haſt ſpent in prayer, ſumme vp all the dayes that thou haſt worne out in religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and canſt thou then truly ſay to <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> did to his vncle, in thy ſeruice night and day haue I macerated my body with heat and cold, and my ſleep departed from mine eyes; twenty yeares haue I labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in thy ſeruice: couldſt thou ſay thus, and ſay it tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:181127:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> ô then what would be the end of thy labour, what would thy reward be? not flocks and cattell, not the daughters of <hi>Laban,</hi> but God himſelfe would be thy exceeding great reward, thy life and happineſſe; Hee would be vnto thee every thing that, thy heart can deſire or long for; Thy ſoule ſhould flowe, and even melt in abundance of ſpirituall delights.</p>
                  <p>But now take a little view of thine owne vileneſſe, thy owne nakedneſſe, thy vttter diſability to any thing that may be truly called good. Thy hands are feeble to Gods worke, thy feete are ſlow to Gods temple, thine eyes are ſeared or ſhut vp towards heaven; But for the workes of fleſh and Sathan, thy heart is hot to envy, thy minde prone to revenge, thy tongue vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble to blaſpheame, thy affections even glued and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated as it were into the ſenſuall embracements; And is this to ſerue God for heaven? ſhall the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Saints,</hi> and the glory of <hi>Angells,</hi> and the ioy, and fruition of <hi>God</hi> himſelfe bee powred forth vpon ſuch workes as theſe? Doſt thou thus requite thy maker.</p>
                  <p>O conſider, conſider I ſay thy waies in time; labour to ſerue <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> did: labour to approue thy ſelfe as faithfull to <hi>God</hi> as <hi>Iacob</hi> was to his vnckle <hi>Laban:</hi> And if the weight of the labour diſcourage thee, or adverſity oppreſſe thee, or proſperity ſeduce thee; then lift vp thine eyes to heaven, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did to his <hi>Rachell:</hi> Let heauen be thy loue, thy ſpouſe, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of thine eyes, the ioy of thy heart; Behold thy <hi>Rachell</hi> is faire, and louely, heaven is both beautifull and glorious: Let thy deſires goe before whither thou
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:181127:26"/> meaneſt to haſten after: ſuffer for a ſeaſon thy light affliction, hauing an eye to the recompence of reward; yet and but a little while,<note place="margin">Eò dirigendus eſt ſpiritus quo aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do eſt itutus.</note> and thou ſhalt approach the haven, where thou ſhalt enioy ſo much the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, by how much the deeper thou haſt drunke in ſorrow; and by how much the more ardent thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions haue beene towards <hi>God</hi> in this life, the more abundant ſhall thy reward be in the life to come; then ſhall thy croſſes proue thy gaines, and that well-ſpring of ioy which ſhall ever riſe in thy heart, ſhall ſwallow vp all thy ſorrowes.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:181127:27"/> will. O the infinite &amp; in expreſſible tenderneſſe of our louing Sauiour towards vs! When we, like ſheepe, had gone aſtray, his mercy reduced vs: When we lay wallowing in our blood, his pitty refreſht vs: When we were dead in our ſinnes, his death did reuiue vs; and here we may truely ſay with <hi>David, his mercy reacheth to the heauens.</hi> From the heauens came the price of our redemption. We were not, neither could we be redeemed by the blood of bulls and goats, by thouſands of riuers of oyle, by the cattle that are vpon a thouſand mountaines. It was not the treaſures of the world, the power of men or Angels could purchaſe this freedome, nothing could cleanſe vs, but the blood of the <hi>Lambe:</hi> He was that fountaine, opened for ſinne and for vncleaneſſe; He was that <hi>Sonne of righteouſnes,</hi> that came with healing in his wings. His were the wounds, that healed our ſores; his was the backe, that bare our ſorrowes; his was the price, that quit our skores; he aſſumed our fleſh to redeeme vs here, and he raignes as a king to crowne vs hereafter. Now what remaines after all this to be done on our parts? Let vs reſt on this <hi>Anchor,</hi> let vs fly to this <hi>hold,</hi> and build on this <hi>foundation: For no other foundation can any man lay, then that which is laid, Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Let vs caſt our ſoules into the armes of our <hi>Saviour: In brachijs Salvatoris mei &amp; vivere volo et mori cupio,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Bernard:</hi> O let this bee our deſire: Now the gate is open, let vs not deferre the time of entrance: Now is the acceptable time, let vs not procraſtinate the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Now he offers his mercy, he ſhewes his long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, let vs not turne his grace into wantonneſſe;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:181127:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> let vs follow the counſell of the ſonne of <hi>Sirach:</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus the 5. <hi>Make no long tarrying to turne to the Lord,</hi> and put not off from day to day: For ſuddainly ſhall the wrath of the Lord breake forth, and in thy ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thou ſhalt bee deſtroyed, and thou ſhalt periſh in time of vengeance. But alas farre otherwiſe it is with vs in our practiſe:<note n="*" place="margin">Magna pars vitae elabitur male agenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, maxima nihil agenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, tota aliud agentibus.</note> A great portion of our time is crumbled away in doing ill, a greater part in doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and our whole life in doing that, which wee ſhould not, or in matters (as we ſay) vpon the by. And as <hi>Archimedes</hi> was ſecure and buſie about drawing lines on the ground when <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was taken; ſo is it with vs. Now that our eternall ſafety laies at ſtake, we lye puzling in our duſt, I meane, in our worldly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations: But for our eternity ſhortly approaching, we ſeldome or rarely thinke of it. We are like <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> troubled about many things, when one thing is neceſſary: But this one thing is that, which of all other things is leaſt regarded, and in the laſt place. Wee ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſeek heauen, till death doth ſummon vs to leaue the earth: wee haue many euaſions to gull our owne hearts, many excuſes to procraſtinate our repentance; like <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> the <hi>Scicilian</hi> king, who to excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for the preſent deliuery of the golden garment, which he tooke from his <hi>God Apollo,</hi> anſwered that ſuch a robe as that was, could not bee at any ſeaſon of the yeare vſefull to his God: it would not keepe him warme in the winter, &amp; it was too heauy for the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: So many there be, ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who play with God and with their owne ſoule. You muſt not (ſay they) ſeeke for the vigour and life of religion in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:181127:28"/> the hearts of young men; For youth, as the prouerbe is, muſt haue his ſwinge: Neither can you expect it in the company of the aged: for their age, and thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, which accompany it, make them a burden to themſelues and dulls the edge of their intentions vnto all their ſerious vnderſtandings. Thus both the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and the winter of our age are vnfit for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. But let vs not thus cheate our ſelues. If God bee God, let vs follow him; let vs not put off the day of reconciliation, and ſay in our hearts to morrow wee will doe it, when yet we cannot tell, what ſhall bee to morrow: for what is our life? It is euen a vapour, that appeares for a little time and afterwards vaniſheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Hence it was that <hi>Macedonius,</hi> being inuited a day before to a feaſt, replied to the meſſenger, why doth thy Maſter inuite me for to morrow, whereas for this many yeares I haue not promiſed to my ſelfe one daies life? <hi>Nemo mortem ſatis cavet, niſi qui ſemper cavet. i.e.</hi> No man dreads death as he ought, but hee that alwaies expects his ſummons; and therefore wee may truly iudge ſuch men wofully ſecure, and wilfull contemners of the future good, who can goe to their beds, and reſt on their pillowes in the apprehenſion of their knowne ſinnes, without a particular humiliation for them. For how oft doth a ſuddain &amp; vnexpected death arreſt men? We ſee and knowe in our dayly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, many lay themſelues to ſleepe in health and ſafety, yet are found dead in the morning. Thus ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly are they wrapt from their quiet repoſe to their irrecouerable iudgement, perchance from their fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to flames of fire; ſuch is the frayle condition of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:181127:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> our brittle liues, within the ſmall particle of an houre, liue and ſicken, and dye: yet ſo groſſe is our blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that from one day to another, nay from one yeare to another, wee triflingly put off the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our liues, vntill our laſt houre creepes on vs vnlookt for, and dragges vs to eternity.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſtriuing with all his endeavours againſt the backwardneſſe and ſlowneſſe of his owne heart to turne to the Lord, bitterly complained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe, <hi>Quamdiu, quamdiu, cras, cras? Quare non hâc horâ finis turpitudinis meae?</hi> How long (ſaith he) ô how long ſhall I delude my ſoule with to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes repentance? Why ſhould not this houre ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate my ſinfulneſſe? Wee are every minute at the brinke of death, and every houre, that wee paſſe through, might proue (for ought we know) the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our whole life, and the very cloſe of our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Now if it ſhould pleaſe God to take away our ſoules from vs this night, (as ſuddenly falls out to ſome) what would then become of vs? In what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity ſhould wee be found? Whether amongſt the damned, or the bleſſed? Happy were it for vs, if wee were but as carefull for the welfare of our ſoules, as wee are curious for the adorning of our bodies: if our clothes or faces doe contract any blot or ſoiling, wee preſently endeavour to cleanſe the ſame: But though our ſoules lye inthralled in the pollutions of ſinne, this alas we feele not; it neither provokes vs to ſhame, nor moues vs to ſorrow. Wherefore let vs looke into our hearts with a ſevearer eye: Let the ſhortneſſe of our daies ſtirre vs vp to the amendment of our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:181127:29"/> liues; &amp; let the houre, wherein we haue ſinned, be the beginning of our reformation, according to that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Ambroſe, agenda eſt paenitentia, non ſolum ſolicitè verùm etiam maturè, i.e.</hi> our repentance muſt be, not only ſincere, but timely alſo, whileſt wee haue the light, let vs walke as children of the light: Let vs not any longer cheate our ſoules in ſtudying to invent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions or pretences for our ſinnes; but rather lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our ſores, and ſeeke to the true <hi>Phyſitian,</hi> that can heale them. All the creatures vnder the ſunne doe naturally intend their owne preſervation and deſire that happineſſe, which is agreeable to their nature: onely man is negligent, and impiouſly careleſſe of his owne welfare. Wee ſee the Hart, when hee is ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and wounded, lookes ſpeedily for a certaine hearbe, well knowne vnto him by a kinde of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inſtinct; and when he hath found it, applies it to the wound. The ſwallow, when her young ones are blind, knowes how to procure them their ſight by the vſe of her Celandine: But wee alas are wounded, yet ſeeke for no remedy; wee goe cuſtomarily to our bedds, to our tables, to our good company; but who is he that obſerues his conſtant courſe of praier, of repentance; of hearty, and ſincere humiliation for his ſinnes? Wee goe forward ſtill in our old way, and jogge on in the ſame rode: Though our judgement haſten, hell threaten, death ſtand at the doore, yet we thruſt onward ſtill; <hi>&amp; in dulcem declinamus lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na ſomnum:</hi> But alas miſerable ſoules as we are, can wee embrace quiet reſts and vninterrupted ſleepes with ſuch wounded conſciences? Can wee be ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:181127:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> being ſo neare our time?</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, wee haue paſſed already many nights without danger; no ſickneſſe in the night hath befalne vs hitherto, why then ſhould any feare of death amaze or trouble vs?</p>
                  <p>Admit all this, yea bee not too confident; one houre may effect that, which a thouſand yeares could not produce: and thinke with your ſelues, what a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſtance there is, betweene your ſoules and death: Let me aske the ſtrongeſt of men on earth, what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of life canſt thou promiſe thy ſelfe, ſeeing that either a little bone in thy throat may choake thee, or a tile from thy houſe may braine thee, or ſome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ayre may poyſon thee, and then where art thou? There are a thouſand waies,<note place="margin">Tu te prius ad aeternita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem abrep tum mirabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, quàm me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tueres abripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum.</note> whereby ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man may come to his end; and certaine it is that; <hi>Mors illa maxime improviſa eſt, cuius vita praecedens non fuit provida, i. e.</hi> that death is the ſuddaineſt, which is not vſhered in with a foregoing preparation. It is therefore a ſpeciall point of wiſdome to thinke every day our laſt, yea to account every houre the period of our liues. For looke how many pores there are in the body, ſo many windowes are there to let in death: yea we carry our deaths continually about vs in our boſomes; and who can promiſe himſelfe his life till the evening? Hath not our owne experience ſhowne vs many, whoſe ſleepes in their beds haue proued ſleepes vnto death; who haue beene carried from their chambers to their graue? Death doth not alwaies ſend forth her harbingers to giue notice of her comming; ſhee often preſſeth in vnlookt for, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:181127:30"/> ſuddainly attached the vnprovided ſoule. Watch therefore, becauſe yee know neither the day, nor the houre: worke whileſt yee haue the day; for the night comes, wherein no man can worke: looke towards thy evening; and caſt thy thoughts vpon that long E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; Death firſt or laſt will apprehend thee: expect it therefore at every turne, and of this aſſure thy ſelfe,<note place="margin">Qualis quiſ<expan>

                  <p>If a man haue a perpetuity but of fiue ſhillings yearely rent, what travell and paines and ſweat, what beating of his braine and exhauſting of his treaſure will he runne through, before he will looſe one dram of his right? Yet our eternall inheritance is caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind vs, and vndervalued as a trifle, not worth the ſeeking; and this ſhewes our ſmall loue to our home: for wee little eſteeme of that, which wee take ſmall paines for.

They ſoone apprehend what belongs to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of behaviour, and deportment of the body, &amp; the faſhions of the times; <hi>Hoc diſcunt omnes ante Alpha &amp; Beta puelli;</hi> but for Heaven and that Eternity, they are wholly averſe from it, they are vtterly vncapable of the things aboue; they carry about them, as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their firſt parents, not only an indiſpoſition, but a very oppoſition to goodneſſe: And whereas for other imployments and vndertakings, they haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine naturall notions in them, bending their intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to naturall workes, ſome one way and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet they haue not ſo much as a naturall appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the things of God.<note place="margin">Homo ſine gratia, praeter carnem nihil ſapit, intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git aut poteſt.</note> Thus it is with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and thus it is with all men, even thoſe of the ripeſt, and moſt peircing vnderſtanding, vntill the light of <hi>Gods</hi> ſpirit hath ſhined on their hearts and powerfully wrought ſome ſpirituall, holy diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them. <hi>The naturall man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth, nor can diſcerne the things that are of God.</hi> O how infinitely-miſerable and deplorable is his ſtate, who hauing neither knowledge of the true life, nor poſſibility of himſelfe to finde it out:<note place="margin">Cum exulſit a patria exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat in via.</note> yet runnes on ſecurely in his damned way, vntill he fall woeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and irrevocably into the pit, where hee will not haue, (no not when hee hath vncomfortably worne out millions of yeares) the leaſt intermiſſion of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or drop of comfort, or hope of pardon? Here
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:181127:31"/> on earth malefactors condemned to dye, haue this comfort (though wretched) that one houre com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly terminates all their griefes in this life: But the torments of the damned are not concluded in an age; nay the end and period of ten thouſand yeares will not end their ſorrowe: And this is it which addes more to their ſufferings, even their vnhappy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the perpetuity of them; they haue not ſo much as any hope of releaſement.</p>
                  <p>Hope in this life hath ſuch a power in it, that it can yeeld ſome comfort in the middeſt of trouble; The ſicke man, whileſt his ſoule is in him, he hath hope, but after this life, this ſmall refreſhment is denied the damned, all their hope is turned into deſperation. The Prophet <hi>Daniell,</hi> cap. 4.14. heard the voice of an holy one, crying, <hi>hew downe the tree, and cut off his branches, ſhake of his leaues, and ſcatter his fruit, neuertheleſſe leaue the ſtumpe of his roote in the earth.</hi> Thus it is with men in this world ſaith <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> their leaues and their flowers are ſhaken; their delights are taken from them; but the rootes remaine, and their hope is not aboliſhed. But it is not ſo in hell; (ſaith he) There both flower and ſtumpe; nay and even all hope too, are baniſhed away from them. The day of the <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> ſhall burne them vp, and leaue them neither roote nor branch. The very hope, ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> of the wicked ſhall periſh; what ſhould this teach vs, but whileſt our hope remaines to improue our few daies to our beſt advantage, to make ſtraighter paths to our ſelues, to abridge our inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate appetites in ſome meaſure of their vaine &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:181127:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> ioyes; and with all the power of our affections ſtriue to attaine that hauen, where no billow ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright vs, no ſtormes aſtoniſh vs, no perills indanger vs? Then ſhall our diſſolution proue our gaine, and our death our glory: if otherwiſe wee perſiſt wilfully in the paths of our voluptuouſneſſe, and ſolace our ſelues in the vaine ioyes of our owne hearts, and in the ſight of our eyes; certainly it will be bitterneſſe in the latter end.<note place="margin">Extrema gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dii luctus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupat.</note> All our earthly delights will glide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way like a ſwift river: <hi>The reioycing of the wicked is ſhort,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob, and the ioy of a ſinner is but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Though his excellency mount vp to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and his head reach vnto the cloudes, yet ſhall he periſh for ever like his dongue, but the righteous is like a ſtrong mountaine and he ſhall bee had in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting remembrance.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore to draw to a concluſion, iuſt occaſion might here be taken for deploring the negligence, and vnhappy condition of our times.

For certaine it is howſoeuer wee liue here like ſecure people of a ſecure age, and howeuer we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh out the ſtrength and flowre of our daies, as if wee ſhould neuer account for it; yet our iudgement is moſt ſure, and ſhall not bee avoided: The ſentence of the Iudge will be one day moſt aſſuredly publiſhed, and ſhall not be revoked: <hi>Wee muſt all appeare</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul) before the iudgement ſeat of Chriſt, that euery one may receaue the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> Then ſhall our wickedneſſe be brought to light which now lies hid in darkneſſe. <hi>I ſaw the dead</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> Rev. 20.12.) <hi>both great and ſmall ſtand before God, and the books were opened and another booke was opened which is the

Oh then let vs prepare our ſelues to meet our God; let vs come before him with feare, and tremble at his iudgements. <hi>Feare not him</hi> (ſaith our Sauiour) <hi>who when he hath killed the body, can doe no more, but feare him, who can caſt both ſoule and body to hell; I ſay him feare.</hi> Oh how many of the Saints of God trembled and quaked when they haue meditated vpon the laſt iudgement. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, as oft as I thinke of that day, how doth my whole body quake, and my heart within me tremble?<note place="margin">Quoties diem illum cogito toto corpore contremiſco.
